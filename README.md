## 🧠 Overview

Cyclic peptides are promising drug candidates due to their ability to target protein–protein interactions. However, their limited membrane permeability remains a major hurdle for intracellular applications. 

In this benchmark study, we systematically evaluate **13 machine learning and deep learning models** for cyclic peptide permeability prediction. These models span **four types of molecular representations**:  
- Fingerprints  
- Strings (e.g., SMILES)  
- Graphs  
- Images  

We test these models across:
- **Three tasks**: regression, binary classification, and soft-label classification  
- **Two data-splitting strategies**: random split and scaffold split  

Our results show that:
- **Graph-based models**, particularly **Directed Message Passing Neural Network (DMPNN)**, consistently achieve top performance.  
- **Regression tasks** generally outperform classification.  
- **Scaffold split**, although better for generalization assessment, leads to lower predictive accuracy than random split.  
- Current models approach the variability of experimental measurements, indicating strong practical value, while still leaving room for further improvement.
